# Dragon Curve

This is my attempt to implement a graphical program in AEC, specifically, a program that will draw the [Dragon Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve). You can (hopefully) see the [live version](https://flatassembler.github.io/dragonCurve.html).

**<del>WARNING: There is a bug in AECforWebAssembly v0.85 preventing this from compiling. You will need to wait for a newer release or compile the AECforWebAssembly from source to try this.</del>** The latest release of AECforWebAssembly can compile this.
