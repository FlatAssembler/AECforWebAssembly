        <span id="compilers_doing_too_much"
          >Compilers these days, even C compilers, have lots of features and are
          often smarter than the programmer when it comes to things they are
          made to do. While this is usually very useful, sometimes it's
          counter-productive. Suppose that you are writing a program in Assembly
          and want to do something high-level (because correctness is way more
          important than speed). You can't tell your C compiler to simply output
          the code to assign <span class="inline_code">sqrt(a*a+b*b)</span> to
          <span class="inline_code">c</span>, if you try to, it will complain
          those variables aren't declared and that you aren't in a C function. C
          compilers have ideas how to declare functions and variables in
          assembly. While these ideas usually work, sometimes you are writing
          something where the assembler will complain if you give it the code
          that C compilers produced for those things, and there is no way to
          modify the code the C compiler outputs for declaring a function in C.
          So, sometimes, compilers, while they could come useful for some task,
          are trying to do too much and are thus counter-productive. In my
          opinion, this is especially true for the mainstream compilers
          targetting <a href="https://youtu.be/cbB3QEwWMlA">WebAssembly</a>, but
          <a href="#about_emscripten">more on that later</a>. Also, compilers
          are buggy, and nearly all compiler bugs are in the optimizer. Can we
          have a language with a compiler that does only what you told it, in a
          very predictable way? Well, that's what inspired me to create
          <i>Arithmetic Expression Compiler</i> (AEC) a few years ago. The first
          programming language I learned was
          <a href="https://smallbasic-publicwebsite.azurewebsites.net/"
            >Microsoft Small Basic</a
          >, I have made a
          <a href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/Labyrinth"
            >Labyrinth game</a
          >
          in it, and it has influenced a lot the decisions I made when designing
          my programming language. Microsoft Small Basic is a simplified
          programming language that compiles to .NET bytecode (the same one that
          C# compiles to), and it is the only language that compiles to .NET
          bytecode that I have managed to learn so far.</span
        ><br /><span id="special_insight"
          >I have also always been interested in languages, both natural and
          artificial (such as programming languages), and making a programming
          language will certainly give me a lot better insight into how
          programming languages really work. That is not quite true for natural
          languages: if you try to make your own constructed language to be
          spoken by humans (similar to Esperanto), and you do not know about
          <i lang="la">consecutio temporum</i>, you will most likely not specify
          how <i lang="la">consecutio temporum</i> is supposed to work in your
          language and you will probably not even realize your grammar has a
          huge hole in its specification (You will assume it is understood by
          itself it will be done the same way as in your native language,
          thinking, like I used to think before learning about
          <i lang="la">consecutio temporum</i> in English, that the way tenses
          are put together in complex sentences in your native language is based
          on logic, rather than that the rules for that are
          essentially-arbitrary. And in case you think all languages with tenses
          follow either the Croatian-like
          <i lang="la">consecutio temporum</i> or the Latin-like
          <i lang="la">consecutio temporum</i>, like I used to think until
          recently, read
          <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EnglishLearning/comments/150dcm7/comment/js2k9x0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3"
            >this Reddit answer to my question about accusative with infinitive
            and <i lang="la">consecutio temporum</i> in English</a
          >. If you use accusative with infinitive in English, you should use
          Croatian-like <i lang="la">consecutio temporum</i>, even though, if
          you use indirect speech with object clauses, you should use Latin-like
          <i lang="la">consecutio temporum</i>. And you don't even need complex
          sentences to show that tenses work very differently in different
          languages, even related ones. In English, an adverbial phrase such as
          &quot;<i>every evening</i>&quot; puts the verb in a simple tense. You
          say &quot;<i>He comes here every evening.</i>&quot;, and &quot;<i
            >He is coming here every evening.</i
          >&quot; is ungrammatical, or is perhaps grammatical for the meaning
          that the speaker is annoyed by him coming. In Croatian, exactly the
          opposite is true: an adverbial phrase such as &quot;<i
            >svaku ve&ccaron;er</i
          >&quot;, meaning &quot;<i>every evening</i>&quot;, puts the sentence
          in a continuous tense. You say &quot;<i
            >On dolazi ovdje svaku ve&ccaron;er.</i
          >&quot;, and &quot;<i>On do&#x0111;e ovdje svaku ve&ccaron;er.</i
          >&quot; sounds very ungrammatical, or is perhaps grammatical for the
          meaning that it is going to happen in the future even though it is not
          happening yet. I have asked a
          <a href="https://latin.stackexchange.com/q/20898/8533"
            >StackExchange question about how it is in Latin</a
          >, another natural language I know somewhat. You will probably not
          realize that such things differ between languages by making your own
          language similar to Esperanto.). But it is true that making a
          programming language gives you a special insight into how programming
          languages, and computers in general, work. Especially if you are
          writing everything yourself (like I am doing), rather than using
          frameworks for tokenizing, parsing and compiling. To be clear, I am
          not saying making your programming language gives you some special
          insight into how languages in general work. Although in

          &quot;<i>pseudo-coordination</i>&quot; - it is a grammatical
          construction found in many languages, including English, which can
          hardly be explained by structural or generative theories of the

          >Also, I think programming in a programming language you have made
          yourself is a good idea because it avoids the bugs that come from
          misunderstanding the programming language you are using. I think that
          is a major source of bugs in programs, yet one that is talked about
          very little. Most of the bugs I've run into came from me
          misunderstanding the language I was using. Quite a few languages, most
          notably JavaScript, try to fix syntactically incorrect programs by
          inserting a semi-colon <span class="inline_code">;</span> according to
          some rules. Sometimes the result of that is really what the programmer
          intended, but quite often it is not. I have run into that problem, not
          in JavaScript, but in Octave, when I was writing
          <a href="toponyms.html#correction"
            >a program to study the relationship between the Shannon entropy and
            the collision entropy</a
          >. It was only when I tried running my program in MatLab (another
          implementation of the same programming language) that I even realized
          there was a bug. Had I used my programming language instead of Octave,
          something like that simply could not have happened to me. And when
          writing my AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler in C++, C++ has surprised me
          quite a few times, and once made a very hard-to-trace bug (you can
          read about it in the <a href="#Structures">Structures section</a>). So
          has JavaScript surprised me a few times when I was writing my
          PicoBlaze assembler and emulator in JavaScript. For example, what do
          you think happens if you pass a string with an invalid number (for
          example, with a letter inside a decimal number, or a digit bigger than
          1 in a binary number) to the JavaScript function
          <span class="inline_code">parseInt</span>? If you have answered that
          it throws an exception, you are wrong. In fact, it returns
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN">a not-a-number</a>. I
          guess it is because the first versions of JavaScript didn't have
          exceptions, but I suppose they did have
          <span class="inline_code">parseInt</span>, which had to signal error
          somehow differently, so that weird way of signalling an error was kept
          because of compatibility. Wrongly thinking it throws an exception
          <a
            href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/PicoBlaze_Simulator_in_JS/issues/27"
            >caused my assembler to fail silently in case somebody writes an
            invalid decimal or binary number</a
          >. Had I written the assembler in my programming language, such a bug
          would be impossible, because I would know how the equivalent of
          <span class="inline_code">parseInt</span> signals an error. When
          programming in a programming language you have made, you understand
          how the tools you are using work, and you have an at least basic
          understanding how the environment you are targetting works (to make a
          compiler targetting WebAssembly, you need to have at least basic
          understanding how modern browsers work), so you are not doing
          bloodletting. WebAssembly is designed to be an exceptionally easy
          target for compilers, so now you can easily program in a programming
          language you have made and make the programs you have written in it
          run in modern browsers.</span

        <br /><b id="Platforms">What platforms can be targeted now</b><br />
        Right now, I've written two compilers for the AEC language. First, I
        wrote one targeting x86 processors (AMD and Intel). That one is written
        in JavaScript and the <a href="compiler.html">core of it</a> can be run
        in browsers that have basic support for JavaScript (even in Internet
        Explorer 6). To use all the features, one needs to use
        <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a> or
        <a href="https://duktape.org/">Duktape</a> with it, to enable it to
        access the file system. Thanks to
        <a href="https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=74881"
          >the help I received from people on VOGONS forum</a
        >, my AEC-to-x86 compiler outputs assembly code that runs on both i486
        in 32-bit mode and on x86_64 processors in 64-bit mode, with no
        modification (it uses <span class="inline_code">ebx</span> register for
        indexing arrays, which is allowed (although not recommended) in 64-bit
        mode, and it does not push and pop 32-bit values from the stack, it only
        pushes and pops 16-bit ones, which is allowed in both 32-bit and 64-bit
        mode, and so on..). When I started studying at the university, many
        professors were impressed by my AEC-to-x86 compiler. My Algorithms and
        Data Structures professor Alfonso Baumgartner urged me to write a
        <a
          href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/ArithmeticExpressionCompiler/raw/master/seminar/PojednostavljeniSeminar.pdf"
        >
          paper</a
        >
        about it which got published in Osje&#269;ki Matemati&#269;ki List. The
        compiler targeting x86 is around 2'000 lines of code (excluding the
        example programs). So, I decided to extend it so that my language can be
        used to target JavaScript Virtual Machine using WebAssembly (the
        JavaScript bytecode, which Mozilla has been pushing to get standardized,
        so that people can run programming languages better than JavaScript in a
        browser), and not only x86. As targeting WebAssembly is easier than
        targeting x86 (or probably any physical processor, as WebAssembly was
        designed to be an easy target for compilers, rather than to be easily
        implemented in hardware or easy to write assembly-language code for
        manually), I was able to add many new features. However, I think it's
        still not nearly as
        <i>intrusive</i> as C compilers are.
        <a href="https://emscripten.org/" id="about_emscripten">Emscripten</a>
        (the primary C and C++ compiler for WebAssembly, a modified version of
        the <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">CLANG</a> compiler) always assumes
        the standard C library is present on the JavaScript Virtual Machine when
        compiling any kind of program, so it's an overkill for most cases when
        it could come useful. The
        <a href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/AECforWebAssembly"
          >AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler</a
        >
        has around 5'500 lines of code, and it's written in C++ (a language much
        more suitable for writing compilers than JavaScript). <br />
        WebAssembly is one of the reasons I am a libertarian, because it shows
        that, when a private company makes a mistake, no matter how hopeless the
        situation seems, there will come a solution... from capitalism itself.
        Making JavaScript, which is widely agreed to be a very poorly-designed
        programming language, a standard language of the Internet, which is what
        Netscape did back when it had a near-monopoly on the Internet
        browsers... for a long time, it seemed like a way to retard the
        development of the Internet forever. Fortunately, once the Internet got
        used more, somebody came up with this brilliant idea of WebAssembly,
        which seems to solve basically all the problems created by Netscape with
        that wrong decision. And, incidentally, that solution also significantly
        lowers the barrier towards making a new programming language, so that
        many more people can experiment with those things. When governments make
        a mistake, quite often, there is no solution. When the UN decided back
        in 1948 that the solution to the Holocaust is to make Palestinians pay
        for the Hitler's crimes with their land... it led to wars which continue
        to this day, and will likely continue all until a nuclear holocaust
        destroys most life on Earth (as has almost happened a few times by now).
        A private company most likely cannot make a mistake with such horrible
        consequences.<br />

        <b>UPDATE</b> on 28/08/2021: As a part of a paper I have written in my
        economics class, I have explained why I chose to target WebAssembly and
        why I think WebAssembly will revolutionalize compilers:
        <div class="quotation" lang="hr" id="why_WebAssembly">
          WebAssembly je dizajniran da bude jako lagan cilj za compilere, daleko
          lakÅ¡i nego asemblerski jezici fiziÄkih procesora. Kada dizajniramo
          asemblerski jezik za fiziÄki procesor, imamo tri trade-offsa
          (pritisaka):
          <ol>
            <li>
              Moramo osigurati da taj asemblerski kod mogu lagano ispisivati
              compileri. Compilerima je najlakÅ¡e ispisivati asemblerske kodove
              za maÅ¡ine bazirane na stogu, i mislim da Äe se svatko tko je
              napravio i najjednostavniji compiler s time sloÅ¾iti. KoriÅ¡tenje
              registara kakvi postoje u fiziÄkim procesorima zahtijeva
              komplicirane algoritme. Compilerima nije vaÅ¾no ima li dovoljno
              registara da se sve varijable pohrane u registar, jer compileri
              lako stave varijable u memoriju i vode raÄuna gdje su. Compilerima
              koji optimiziraju kod smeta postojanje nevaÅ¾nih instrukcija u
              asemblerskom jeziku, jer im je onda teÅ¡ko procijeniti je li
              asemblerski kod koji ih koristi optimalniji ili manje optimalan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Moramo osigurati da taj asemblerski kod mogu relativno lagano
              pisati ljudi. Jer, suoÄimo se s time, neki se programi nuÅ¾ni za
              rad raÄunala, kao Å¡to su bootloaderi, ne mogu pisati u viÅ¡im
              programskim jezicima, a joÅ¡ su se manje mogli prije 50-ak godina
              kada su osnove asemblerskih jezika kojima se sluÅ¾e danaÅ¡nji (x86,
              ARM...) procesori dizajnirane. Ljudima je, mislim da Äe se svatko
              tko je pisao asemblerski kod sloÅ¾iti, najlakÅ¡e pisati asemblerski
              kod za procesore s mnogo registara, a teÅ¡ko im je koristiti stog
              za raÄunanje, gotovo suprotno nego Å¡to je lagano compilerima. A
              voditi raÄuna o tome koliko je koja lokalna varijabla udaljena od
              vrha sistemskog stoga, Å¡to je compilerima jako lagano, za ljude je
              gotovo nemoguÄa misija. Ljudima koji piÅ¡u asemblerske kodove dobro
              doÄu compilerima nevaÅ¾ne instrukcije kao Å¡to su
              <code>fsin</code> (sporo, ali ekstremno precizno raÄunanje
              sinusa), koje optimizirajuÄim compilerima koji pokuÅ¡avaju
              modelirati procesor smetaju.
            </li>
            <li>
              Procesor koji Äe razumjeti taj asemblerski kod (toÄnije, strojni
              kod koji odgovara tom asemblerskom kodu naredbu-po-naredbu) mora
              biti moguÄe efikasno fiziÄki implementirati. Jer, suoÄimo se s
              time, na kraju krajeva, procesori su Å¾ice. Moderni procesori su
              bezbroj Å¾ica spojenih na naÄin toliko kompliciran da ti glava
              pukne i da ti bude drago Å¡to o tome ne uÄite na fakultetu.
              Zapravo, vjerojatno ti ni jedna osoba ne bi mogla objasniti kako
              moderni procesori funkcioniraju. No, ipak, oÄito je da asemblerski
              jezici koji semantiÄki pruÅ¾aju neograniÄeno velik stog ili
              proizvoljan broj registara ne mogu biti efikasno implementirani
              Å¾icama.
            </li>
          </ol>
          WebAssembly ne podlijeÅ¾e drugom i treÄem pritisku, i zato je izuzetno
          lagan cilj za compilere. Java bytecode zamiÅ¡ljen je da se moÅ¾e
          implementirati fiziÄki, i zato, za razliku od WebAssemblyja, podlijeÅ¾e
          treÄem pritisku. Dakle, danas, zahvaljujuÄi WebAssemblyju, tko ne
          Å¾eli, ne mora koristiti JavaScript za front-end programiranje, veÄ
          moÅ¾e i neki drugi programski jezik. Kako je WebAssembly lagan cilj za
          compilere, relativno je lagano dizajnirati svoj programski jezik i
          napraviti compiler koji Äe ga prevoditi u WebAssembly. To sam i ja
          napravio, i to je najveÄi program koji sam napisao do sada, ima 5'500
          redaka i pisan je u C++-u.

        If everything is fine, the Analog Clock program should now print the

        majority of Linux machines, as well as on many non-Linux (FreeBSD,
        Solaris...) machines. A potential problem is that the 32-bit libraries
        are not installed on a 64-bit Linux machine (so that
        <span class="inline_code">-m32</span> fails), but this is rarely the
        case, as Linux machines today usually have
        <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">WINE</a> (a Windows compatibility
        layer requiring 32-bit libraries), or at least some 32-bit programs.
        Needless to say, this will not work on Linux running on ARM processors,
        such as Android or Raspberry Pi. Also, the Analog Clock program probably
        cannot be run on Windows (I haven't managed to try it using
        <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">CygWin</a>, but I am quite sure it
        wouldn't run on Windows even if I managed to install Cygwin. (<i
          >UPDATE on 08/05/2021: I have found a relatively simple way to modify
          the <span class="inline_code">analogClock.aec</span> so that it can be

          <a href="https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php">MinGW-W64</a>, and thus run

          Unfortunately, it still shows a lot of errors if you attempt to
          assemble it using the versions of GNU Assembler that come with TDM-GCC
          or CygWin. Apparently, the versions of GNU Assembler that come with
          various ports of GCC on Windows are different from each other to a
          greater extent than the version of GNU Assembler that runs on Linux
          and one that comes with MinGW-W64 are. I find that both surprising and
          somewhat unfortunate. What is especially unfortunate is the fact that

          that comes with CLANG on Windows. However, the GNU Assembler that
          comes with MinGW-W64 and the LLVM Assembler that comes with CLANG on
          Windows do not output the same machine code. The executable produced

          assembled by CLANG on Windows, although it works on both 32-bit and
          64-bit Windows 10, for some reason that escapes me, it refuses to run
          on Windows XP. You can assemble the assembly code produced by my
          compiler for the
          <span class="inline_code">analogClockForWindows.aec</span>, which will
          be called <span class="inline_code">analogClockForWindows.s</span>,
          using MinGW-w64, and then it will run on Windows XP, but it will be
          slower. Again, the explanation for that escapes me. An obvious
          explanation would be that MinGW-w64 includes some kind of a polyfill
          for functions missing on Windows XP, that make the executable able to
          run on it, but make it slower. But the problem with that explanation
          is that, actually, the executable produced by CLANG is bigger than the
          executable produced by MinGW-w64. If the executable by MinGW-w64 were
          polyfilled, we would expect it to be bigger, rather than smaller.

        <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/rhino">Rhino</a> (a JavaScript

        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/">Swing GUI</a
        >. It an be used as a simple calculator, but it also supports converting
        AEC programs to x86 assembly. The AEC-to-x86 compiler, both when run in
        Rhino and when run in Duktape, can output assembly in two formats, one
        compatible with FlatAssembler, and one compatible with GNU Assembler. To
        switch between them, use
        <span class="inline_code">syntax fasm</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">syntax gas</span>. By default, it targets
        FlatAssembler. When targeting GNU Assembler, keep in mind that the
        directive <span class="inline_code">syntax gas</span> needs to be the
        very first directive in your program, even before any comments. Namely,
        the AEC-to-x86 compiler passes the comments down to the assembler, but
        FlatAssembler begins comments with <span class="inline_code">;</span>,
        whereas GNU Assembler begins comments with
        <span class="inline_code">#</span>. To GNU Assembler, semi-colon
        <span class="inline_code">;</span> means to have multiple
        assembly-language directives in a single line (useful for when invoked
        from a debugger, where you need to inline a few directives).<br />
        <a name="GCC_requires_lm"></a>By the way, in case you are interested,
        here is how <i>zero9178</i> (a friend I met on Discord, who maintains
        his own GCC port to Windows) explains the fact that putting
        <span class="inline_code">-lm</span> in front of source files causes an
        error on some (but, curiously, not all) versions of Linux:
        <div class="quotation">
          Only a very educated guess, but GNU ld is very sensitive to link order
          of archives and lazily loads archives.<br />
          More specifically what is likely happening here is that it is passing
          <span class="inline_code">-lm</span> first, before any object files to
          the linker (you can see the linker invocation GCC does by adding
          <span class="inline_code">-v</span> that should give you more
          info).<br />
          Since at that point in time, there are no undefined symbols, as object
          files have not been processed yet, the
          <span class="inline_code">-lm</span> is effectively discard. <br />
          Later <span class="inline_code">-lm</span> are likely discard too as
          they are seen as duplicates of the first one. <br />
          Usually <span class="inline_code">-lm</span> would be placed further
          back, since later object files or other archives that require symbols
          from it will have already been imported by the linker.

        Again, if everything is fine, the Analog Clock program should print the
        current time in the terminal. However, in order for this to work, you
        need to have NodeJS installed, which is often not the case. You also
        need to have a version of NodeJS newer than one which is usually shipped
        with Linux, as Debian-like Linux distributions today usually ship with
        NodeJS 10, and CentOS-like distributions with NodeJS 6, and the code my
        compiler generates relies on
        <span class="inline_code">WebAssembly.Global</span> being present, which
        is only true on NodeJS 11 and newer. For the exactly same reason, the
        code my compiler produces will not run in Firefox 52, which is the last
        version of Firefox to run on Windows XP, and the first one to support
        WebAssembly. I think I made the right decision not to waste time
        supporting the earliest implementations of WebAssembly, as almost nobody
        will notice my effort, and I'd need to put a lot of it.

        (If you really need the AEC programs to work in old browsers, perhaps
        you could try decompiling them using
        <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/tree/main/wasm2c"
          ><span class="inline_code">wasm2c</span> from WebAssembly Binary
          Toolkit</a
        >
        and somehow re-compiling them using Emscripten (I haven't tried it
        myself, but I speculate it may be possible). Or you may try to somehow
        polyfill WebAssembly, which the
        <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/faq/">FAQ of WebAssembly</a> says
        is, in principle, possible. But I am quite sure you would need to
        polyfill the entire WebAssembly, and not just
        <span class="inline_code">WebAssembly.Global</span>.) Of course, in
        order for <span class="inline_code">npx -p wabt wat2wasm</span> to work,
        you either need to have
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wabt">WABT</a> already installed,
        or you need to be connected to the Internet so that
        <span class="inline_code">npx</span> can download it (which you probably
        do as you recently cloned from GitHub, but the firewall also needs to
        enable access to <span class="inline_code">npmjs.com</span>, which fewer
        firewalls do). If you want to use AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler on an OS
        that's not compatible with Linux, well, good luck. I have provided some
        executable files of my compiler for different OS-es, including FreeDOS
        (compiled using
        <a href="https://github.com/andrewwutw/build-djgpp"
          >DJGPP C++ compiler</a
        >), in case it helps, as the
        <a href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/AECforWebAssembly/releases"
          >assets to the releases of AECforWebAssembly</a
        >. Especially good luck using WABT and NodeJS there (I believe WABT can
        be made to run on FreeDOS, but with a lot of difficulty, and that NodeJS
        cannot be made to run on FreeDOS even with a lot of effort.) Sorry, but
        dealing with binary files is complicated, and me building an assembler
        for WebAssembly into my compiler (instead of simply outputting assembly)
        would give me a lot of hassle and very little benefit. I hope you
        understand. And, if you are going to try to run the
        <span class="inline_code">analogClock.html</span> file in a browser,
        please note it will not work unless you are using a web server such as
        <span class="inline_code">php -S 127.0.0.1:8080</span>. It has to do
        with sandboxing and external WebAssembly not being trusted by browsers.
        If you are running untrusted WebAssembly (not produced by the JavaScript
        compiler in the browser itself) from your harddrive, the JavaScript
        Virtual Machine cannot be sandboxed not to read or modify or delete the
        data on your harddrive. That is why contemporary web-browsers disallow
        that (just like, when JavaScript was in its infancy, browsers did not
        allow JavaScript on your harddrive to be run without your explicit
        permission). If you are running WebAssembly from a web server, it can be
        sandboxed so that it cannot harm your computer.<br />A friend I met on

        to run around an order of magnitude faster (that is, 10 times faster) on

        faster than on GitLab CI (that is, GitLab CI seems to be around 2 times
        faster than my laptop). I am not sure why, as I expected my compiler to
        run very poorly in computer clouds, because computer clouds are, as far
        as I understand it, made of countless low-powered computers which can be
        well-used only by programs that support parallel execution, which my

        about that. Nevertheless, I think the hypothesis that it does not
        actually run there (and that is the reason why it seems to run so
        quickly) can be eliminated, as subsequent tests would fail (WABT invoked
        in

        exit with an error message, and so would NodeJS invoked by

        were the case. The tokenizer of my compiler runs very slowly, and I do
        not know how to make it faster. I have made a

        <span class="inline_code">#target WASI</span> before any declarations.
        Unlike with AEC-to-x86
        <span class="inline_code">syntax gas</span> directive, comments can go
        before that. I believe this a significant step forward on a way for the
        WebAssembly dialect of AEC to run on rarely used operating systems such
        as FreeDOS, using portable WASI environments such as
        <a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3">Wasm3</a>. Of course, that is
        assuming we also manage to compile
        <span class="inline_code">wat2wasm</span> from WebAssembly Binary
        Toolkit to run there (which will not be easy because CMAKE does not run
        there). Also, some

        <b>UPDATE</b> on 09/01/2023: Here is how my AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler
        can be compiled using latest Emscripten:

emcc -o aec.js AECforWebAssembly.cpp -s NODERAWFS=1 -s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -s TOTAL_STACK=4MB -O3</pre

        Previous versions of Emscripten did not require
        <span class="inline_code">-s TOTAL_STACK=4MB</span>, but the latest
        version does, because of

          >this pull request</a
        >.<br />
        <b>UPDATE</b> on 05/05/2023: Here is how you can cross-compile my
        AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler from Windows to 64-bit Linux using Docker:
        <pre class="LinuxShell">
PS E:\My programs\AECforWebAssembly> docker run --rm -v "$($PWD):/usr/src/myapp" -w /usr/src/myapp gcc:13.1 g++ -o aec.elf AECforWebAssembly.cpp -static -O3</pre
        >
        Of course, you should replace <span class="inline_code">13.1</span> with
        the version of GCC you want to use. The newer the GCC version, the more
        optimized the output will be, but you are risking running into trouble
        because of the poor backwards compatibility (C++ is not JavaScript,
        where you can expect a program that works now to work forever). For
        instance, GCC 13.1 started to require
        <span class="inline_code">#include &lt;cstdint&gt;</span> in order to
        use <span class="inline_code">uint8_t</span> and similar typenames,
        which

        once GitLab started using GCC 13.1 (which is how I came to know about

        run on any Linux machine that has the C++ library older than GCC 13.1 in
        Docker uses (which are, as of time of writing this, all Linux
        distributions except Fedora). It is also a good idea to run

        <b id="Comments">Comments</b><br />
        In the version of AEC targeting x86, the comments start with
        <span class="inline_code">;</span> and end with a newline character, as
        in FlatAssembler dialect of Assembly (which ArithmeticExpressionCompiler
        primarily targets), and there are no multi-line comments. In the version
        of AEC for WebAssembly, the comments are as in C, C++ and JavaScript,
        single-line comments start with <span class="inline_code">//</span>, and
        multi-line comments start with <span class="inline_code">/*</span> and
        end with <span class="inline_code">*/</span>. Multi-line comments do not
        nest (as they do in, for example, Swift). Many people say multi-line
        comments are a bad thing because bad programmers use them for versioning
        code (which is a very bad practice). I don't think the job of the
        compiler is to enforce some particular programming style and refuse to
        compile code-smelling programs (though warnings are often useful).<br />
        <br /><b id="Constants">Constants</b><br />
        In AEC for x86, a token that consists of numbers and at most one point
        is a number, and all numbers are treated as 32-bit decimal numbers. In
        both dialects of AEC, a string is a token which starts and ends with
        <span class="inline_code">&quot;</span>, and strings are passed
        unchanged to the assembler. String tokens next to each other are
        concatenated by the tokenizer into one string (as in C and C++, in
        contrast with JavaScript). In both dialects of AEC, a token consisting
        of three characters of which both the first one and the last one are
        <span class="inline_code">'</span> is a number, and the tokenizer
        replaces it with a number equal to the ASCII code of the second
        character in that token (like in most dialects of x86 assembly). In AEC
        for WebAssembly, a token which matches the regular expression
        <span class="inline_code">"(^\\d+$)|(^0x(\\d|[a-f]|[A-F])+$)"</span> is
        of type <span class="inline_code">Integer64</span> and is passed
        unchanged to the assembler (notice that this includes hexadecimal
        numbers starting with <span class="inline_code">0x</span>, as in C, C++
        and JavaScript). A token which matches the regular expression
        <span class="inline_code">"^\\d+\\.\\d*$"</span> is of the type
        <span class="inline_code">Decimal64</span> and is also passed unchanged
        to the assembler (or, in case it is to be assigned as an initial value
        of a global variable, it is converted to IEEE754 hexadecimal). In AEC
        for x86, a token which matches the regular expression
        <span class="inline_code">"^\\d+\\.\\d*$"</span> is, just like all
        numbers, of type <span class="inline_code">Decimal32</span> and is
        always converted to IEEE754 hexadecimal (unless it's run in a JavaScript
        environment that doesn't support
        <span class="inline_code">ArrayBuffer</span>, in that case, only
        FlatAssembler can be targetted, as FlatAssembler can convert decimal
        numbers to IEEE754 hexadecimals itself). Notice that in AEC for
        WebAssembly, <span class="inline_code">3/2=1</span> (as in C, C++, Java,
        C#, Rust and Python 2.x), while, in AEC for x86,
        <span class="inline_code">3/2=1.5</span> (as in JavaScript, PHP, LISP
        and Python 3.x). It's hard to tell which approach is better, both can
        produce hard-to-find bugs. The Pascal-like approach of using different
        operators for integer division and decimal division probably makes the
        most sense (Pascal uses <span class="inline_code">/</span> for
        floating-point division and <span class="inline_code">div</span> for
        integer division. Similarly, Dart uses
        <span class="inline_code">/</span> for floating-point division and
        <span class="inline_code">~/</span> for integer division), but it will
        also undeniably feel alien to most programmers. I have started a

        The support for multi-line strings will probably never be added to the
        AEC-to-x86 compiler, since AEC-to-x86 compiler does not tokenize the
        whole program before compiling, but tokenizes line-by-line, so it would
        need to be significantly restructured to support multi-line-strings. I
        like the way C++ supports multi-line strings more than I like the way
        JavaScript supports them. In JavaScript, namely, multi-line strings
        begin and end with a backtick <span class="inline_code">`</span>, which
        was presumably made under the assumption that long hard-coded strings
        (for which multi-line strings are used) would never include a back-tick.
        That does not seem like a reasonable assumption. C++ allows us to
        specify which string surrounded by a closed paranthesis
        <span class="inline_code">)</span> and the quote sign
        <span class="inline_code">&quot;</span> we think will never appear in
        the text stored as a multi-line string (in the example above, those were
        an empty string in <span class="inline_code">first</span>, the string
        <span class="inline_code">ab</span> in
        <span class="inline_code">second</span>, and the string
        <span class="inline_code">a</span> in
        <span class="inline_code">third</span>), and the programmer will
        more-than-likely be right about that. Java does not support multi-line
        strings at all, supposedly to discourage hard-coding of large texts into
        a program. I think that is not the right thing to do, primarily because
        multi-line strings have many good uses: they arguably make the
        AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler, written in C++, more legible. Parser tests
        and large chunks of assembly code are written as multi-line strings
        there, and I think rightly so. I have opened a

        In the version of AEC targeting x86, there are no variable declarations
        in the language itself, the compiler simply assumes any token that
        matches the regular expression
        <span class="inline_code">"^(_|[A-Z]|[a-z])\\w*\\[?$"</span>
        and is not a keyword is a name of a variable of type 32-bit decimal
        number or 32-bit decimal number array (if it ends with
        <span class="inline_code">[</span>) that's been previously declared in
        assembly. In the version of AEC targeting WebAssembly, variables are
        declared with:
        <pre>DataType name_of_the_variable;</pre>
        Where <span class="inline_code">DataType</span> is
        <span class="inline_code">Character</span>,

          <span class="inline_code">v2.2.0</span> (not released as of the time

          <span class="inline_code">PointerToCharacter</span> instead of
          <span class="inline_code">CharacterPointer</span>,
          <span class="inline_code">PointerToInteger32</span> instead of
          <span class="inline_code">Integer32Pointer</span>, and so on. I think
          <span class="inline_code">PointerToCharacter</span> is a name that is
          far harder to misinterpret, as somebody might think
          <span class="inline_code">CharacterPointer</span> is a character that
          is also a pointer.</i
        >) The compiler assumes the pointers are 32-bit and characters are
        8-bit, which is true in the vast majority of cases. There is also a way
        to initialize a variable:
        <pre>DataType name_of_the_variable := initial_value;</pre>
        Without that, global variables are zero by default, and local variables
        contain whatever happens to be on the top of the system stack at the
        time of their declarations (as in C or C++). In Ada and old versions of
        C, variables must be declared on the top of a scope, before any other
        statement. There is no such restriction in AEC. However, the initial
        values to global variables must be compile-time constants. That means,
        you can't refer to other global variables or to AEC functions. However,
        when writing an initial value for a decimal variable, you can use C
        library (available to the compiler) functions and constants, such as
        <span class="inline_code">sin(x)</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">asin(x)</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">atan2(y,x)</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">pi</span> or
        <span class="inline_code">e</span>. The same doesn't work when assigning
        initial values to local variables. It's possible to declare multiple
        variables of the same type in the same statement by separating them with
        a comma <span class="inline_code">,</span> (as in C, C++ and
        JavaScript). For example (excerpt from the
        <a href="dragonCurve.html">Dragon Curve</a>):
        <pre>
Integer32 directionX[4]    := { 0, 1, 0, -1},
          directionY[4]    := {-1, 0, 1,  0},
          currentX         := 10,
          currentY         := 250 + 490 - 410, //When set on 250, the turtle
                                               //reaches 410 and then turns
                                               //back (I know this by
                                               //experimenting).
          currentDirection := 0,
          lineLength       := 5,
          lineWidth        := 2,
          currentStep      := 0;
        </pre>
        I like the C-like approach to declaring multiple variables in the same
        statement way more than the Ada-and-VHDL-like approach, yet alone the
        Rust-like approach. I realize the Rust-like approach makes theoretically
        much more sense, but it definitely feels weird to somebody coming from
        another programming language.<br />
        <b>TODO</b>: Decide what to do about aligning the variables in memory
        (making sure that, for example, a
        <span class="inline_code">Integer32</span> is on the memory location
        divisible by 4). Aligning variables wastes memory, sometimes around half
        of the allocated memory ends up unused because of the aligning. On the
        other hand, for the interoperability with other languages, it is
        probably desirable for variables and arrays to be aligned. JavaScript
        throws an exception on attempted unaligned access, while in C and C++,
        it is supported by some compilers and optimization levels but not in
        others (it's undefined behavior). Right now, the AEC compiler doesn't
        make sure the variables are aligned, which I am not sure is the best
        approach. Also, while JavaScript Virtual Machine does allow unaligned
        memory access, it's not guaranteed to be nearly as fast as aligned
        access (on x86, it usually is, on ARM, it's many times slower).<br />
        <br /><b id="Arrays">Arrays and Pointers</b><br />
        In the x86 dialect of AEC, you don't declare arrays in AEC, the compiler
        assumes any arrays you mention in AEC are declared in inline assembly
        (just like it does for variables). In the x86 dialect of AEC, you can
        reference an array called <span class="inline_code">fib</span> either as
        <span class="inline_code">fib(0)</span> (as in BASIC) or as
        <span class="inline_code">fib[0]</span> (as in C). In the WebAssembly
        dialect of AEC, you can only do that as
        <span class="inline_code">fib[0]</span>.<br />
        In the WebAssembly dialect of AEC, arrays are declared as follows:
        <pre>DataType name_of_the_array[size];</pre>
        They can be initialized as follows:
        <pre>
DataType name_of_the_array[size] := {first_element, second_element...};</pre
        >
        Note that, unlike in C, if you put only one element in the initializer
        list (between <span class="inline_code">{</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">}</span>), only the first element is
        initialized with that value, while others are left uninitialized (or
        are, in the case of global variables, set to zero). Makes a lot more
        sense to me than those complicated rules C and C++ have for initializing
        arrays. In C and C++, you can use array-style syntax with pointers or
        pointer-style syntax with arrays most of the time, except in some
        confusing scenarios. In AEC, you can never do those things. To the AEC
        compiler, the array is named
        <span class="inline_code">name_of_the_array[</span> rather than
        <span class="inline_code">name_of_the_array</span>, and attempting to
        use <span class="inline_code">name_of_the_array</span> to refer to the
        pointer to the first element of the array (as you can usually do in C or
        C++) leads to "undeclared variable" error (since the compiler is using
        <a
          href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/AECforWebAssembly/blob/644f80b37a6d1233cb6c440aa877504ce9a46a98/TreeNode.cpp#L117"
          >Levenshtein Distance</a
        >
        to provide suggestions for misspelled variable names, it will almost
        certainly suggest you the array name then, with the
        <span class="inline_code">[</span> at the end, since it will have the
        Levnstein Distance of <span class="inline_code">1</span>). This can be
        confusing to those who come from C or C++, but it makes a lot more sense
        to me. Or, you can make it behave in the C-like manner (if it makes your
        code shorter) like this (excerpt from the
        <a href="analogClock.html">Analog Clock in AEC</a>):
        <pre>
    Character signature[100] := {0};
    CharacterPointer signature := AddressOf(signature[0]);
    //AEC, unlike C, always makes a clear distinction between
    //arrays and pointers.

        Makes a lot more sense to me than to use the same operator as for the
        multiplication, like C or C++ do (they use
        <span class="inline_code">*</span> for both of those things). Using the
        same operator for declaring a pointer as for multiplication in fact
        makes C and C++ significantly more difficult to parse in some cases,
        this is called the <i>typedef problem</i>. In C and C++, the statement
        <span class="inline_code">first * second;</span> can mean both &quot;<i
          >Declare a pointer to the type named
          <span class="inline_code">first</span>, and name that pointer
          <span class="inline_code">second</span>.</i
        >&quot; and the far less sensible statement &quot;<i
          >Multiply variables named <span class="inline_code">first</span> and
          <span class="inline_code">second</span>, store the result on the
          system stack and then ignore it.</i
        >&quot;, depending on the context (whether
        <span class="inline_code">first</span> is a name of a type or a name of
        a variable, which one cannot know during the parsing phase of
        compiling). In the dialect of AEC targeting x86, it can only mean the
        second one (with the modification that the result is not stored on the
        system stack, but to a memory location where the pointer
        <span class="inline_code">result</span>, which is supposed to be
        declared in inline assembly, points to), and, in the dialect of AEC
        targeting WebAssembly, the compiler complains if you write something
        like that because WebAssembly itself does not let you store a result on
        system stack and then pretend it is not there, that is, it does not
        support expressions which are not assigned to anything. To get a pointer
        to something, you use the
        <span class="inline_code">AddressOf(</span> operator. Makes a lot more
        sense to me than the way C and C++ do that, using the same operator as
        for the <i>bitwise and</i> operation (they use
        <span class="inline_code">&amp;</span>). AEC for x86 doesn't support
        pointers at all. Note that, like in C and C++ (but unlike in JavaScript
        or Assembly),
        <span class="inline_code"
          >name_of_some_integer32pointer := name_of_some_integer32pointer +
          1</span
        >
        increases the value stored in it by 4 (the size of
        <span class="inline_code">Integer32</span>), rather than by 1.<br />

        <br /><b id="Assignments">Assignments</b><br />
        For assignments, you use <span class="inline_code">:=</span> operator,
        in both dialects of AEC. In the AEC for WebAssembly, you can nest
        assignment expressions, like this (excerpt from HybridSort):
        <pre>
    broj_obrnuto_poredanih_podniza  :=
        broj_vec_poredanih_podniza  :=

        >
        After that, all 5 variables will be 0. You can't do that in AEC for x86.
        In AEC for WebAssembly, assignment statements end with a semicolon
        <span class="inline_code">;</span> and can run across multiple lines. In
        AEC for x86, they end with a newline character. In AEC for x86, there is
        also the string-assignment operator

        <b>UPDATE</b> on 15/07/2021: In most programming languages these days,
        the assignment operator is <span class="inline_code">=</span>, whereas
        the equality-testing operator is <span class="inline_code">==</span>.
        The rationale for that, dating back to the C programming language, is
        that most programs more commonly do variable assignments than they do
        testing for equality between variables, so that it makes sense to use a
        shorter operator for a more common operation that is assignment. While
        that may have made sense back then, I don't think that makes any sense
        with modern computers. Beginners in programming are in particular often
        confused by <span class="inline_code">=</span> meaning assignment,
        rather than something they are used to from mathematics. Also, I believe
        everybody who has programmed in a C-like language can agree that thing
        about equality operator being two assignment operators often leads to
        bugs. Namely, one of the most common errors in C-like languages is that
        the programmer mistypes
        <span class="inline_code">if (variable==0)</span> as
        <span class="inline_code">if (variable=0)</span>, leading to the value
        in <span class="inline_code">variable</span> being lost and the block of
        code after that <span class="inline_code">if</span> never being
        executed. C# attempts to solve that problem by disallowing implicitly
        converting to the boolean type in the if-conditions, which is an
        interesting solution, but it often makes the code longer, as well as not
        addressing the fact that the same problem can happen with boolean
        variables (<i
          >UPDATE on 05/06/2024:

          >, causing my compiler to lose track of the sizes of the structures
          and cause an internal compiler error, was caused by mismatched
          parentheses, which C++ compiler didn't complain about, but instead it
          implicitly casted an integer into boolean. Had I written my compiler
          in Java or C#, rather than in C++, something like that couldn't have
          happened to me.</i
        >). So, I think that making <span class="inline_code">:=</span> the
        assignment operator and <span class="inline_code">=</span> the
        equality-testing operator is a good choice. The AEC-to-WebAssembly
        compiler allows whitespace between
        <span class="inline_code">:</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">=</span> in the assignment operator
        <span class="inline_code">:=</span>, so that, when
        <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html">ClangFormat</a>
        mistakes <span class="inline_code">:</span> for the label-ending sign
        and puts a whitespace after it, the code does not lose its meaning. I am
        not sure now whether that was a good choice. I have created a

        The first argument of the ternary conditional operator is converted to

          last two arguments of the ternary conditional operator is a structure,
          but the other is either a structure of a different type, or not a
          structure at all, the semantic analyzer reports an error. In previous
          versions of AECforWebAssembly, that caused the compiler to crash. See
          <a href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/AECforWebAssembly/issues/19"
            >this GitHub issue</a
          >

        >). The strongest types are pointers, next comes
        <span class="inline_code">Decimal64</span>, then
        <span class="inline_code">Decimal32</span>, then
        <span class="inline_code">Integer64</span>, then
        <span class="inline_code">Integer32</span>, then comes
        <span class="inline_code">Integer16</span>, while the weakest type is
        <span class="inline_code">Character</span>. Most binary operands convert
        both of their operands to the stronger type, except for the assignment
        operator, the <span class="inline_code">and</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">or</span> operator. The assignment operator
        converts the right-hand side operand to the type of the left-hand-side
        operand. In case one of them is a pointer and the other one isn't, the
        compiler issues a warning. The bitwise
        <span class="inline_code">and</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">or</span> convert both operands to
        <span class="inline_code">Integer32</span>. There are no logical
        <span class="inline_code">and</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">or</span> operators in AEC (like the C and C++
        <span class="inline_code">and</span> and

        <span class="inline_code">&amp;&amp;</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">||</span>). This can lead to some confusing
        behavior. For instance, <span class="inline_code">1 and 2</span> would
        be <span class="inline_code">1</span> in C and C++, but it's
        <span class="inline_code">0</span> in AEC. To convert a number to
        Boolean, you can use the built-in function
        <span class="inline_code">not(x)</span>, like this (from HybridSort):
        <pre>
        velicina_niza / (64 * 1024 / 4) +
        not(not(mod(velicina_niza, 64 * 1024 / 4))) &gt;

        not(not(mod(prijasnja_velicina_niza, 64 * 1024 / 4))) or
        prijasnja_velicina_niza = 0</pre
        >
        Namely, <span class="inline_code">not(not(x))</span> returns
        <span class="inline_code">1</span> if
        <span class="inline_code">x</span> is not
        <span class="inline_code">0</span>, and
        <span class="inline_code">0</span> if
        <span class="inline_code">x=0</span>. You can also use
        <span class="inline_code">not(x=0)</span>. There is no built-in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">exclusive or</a>
        function or operator in AEC, but you can easily build one like this
        (excerpt from
        <a href="arithmeticOperatorsTest.html">Arithmetic Operators Test</a>):
        <pre>
Function xor(Integer32 first,
             Integer32 second)

        //I hope people will like the way I named the bit-operators.
        Return (first and invertBits(second)) or (invertBits(first) and second);
EndFunction</pre
        >
        As you can see, there is a built-in
        <span class="inline_code">invertBits(Integer32 x)</span> function which
        inverts the bits in an integer. Internally, it
        <span class="inline_code">xor</span>-s
        <span class="inline_code">x</span> with
        <span class="inline_code">-1</span>.<br />
        <b>UPDATE</b> on 30/11/2023: With the new versions of AEC (supporting
        easy-to-use inline assembly), there is an even simpler way to implement
        the xor-operation in AEC:

        <b id="chained_comparisons">UPDATE</b> on 28/04/2024: I've implemented
        the chained comparisons operators. For instance, this function:
        <pre>
Function testChainedComparisons() Which Returns Integer32 Does
	Return (1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3) and not(2 &lt; 3 &lt; 1) and (-3 &lt; -2 &lt; -1);

        It returns 1 if it is compiled using AECforWebAssembly v2.8.0 (not
        released as of writing this), but it returns 0 if it's compiled with
        AECforWebAssembly v2.7.0.<br />
        Unfortunately, the implementation is incorrect. All it does is to
        rewrite <span class="inline_code">a &lt; b &lt; c</span> to
        <span class="inline_code">a &lt; b and b &lt; c</span>, which will, of
        course, evaluate <span class="inline_code">b</span> twice. That is
        incorrect whenever <span class="inline_code">b</span> has side-effects.
        You can see how it's implemented

          href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/AECforWebAssembly/blob/520f8e97f47f2d6c4cd793ab1f222e49ef5e4158/compiler.cpp#L1360"

        That problem might seem similar to the problem which occurs when
        compiling <span class="inline_code">+=</span> and similar operators,
        when incrementing an element of an array with the index being a function
        with side-effects, but that's actually not the same problem. There
        doesn't seem to be such a simple solution (of using a local temporary
        variable) to the problem with chained comparisons.

        <b>UPDATE</b> on 22/09/2024: I've received some comments on Internet
        forums telling me that the <i>scanning backwards</i> method of parsing
        right-associative operators (as I was doing both in my PicoBlaze
        assembler and in my AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler, but not in my
        AEC-to-x86 compiler) is considered to be an anti-pattern. So, I've
        opened
        <a href="https://langdev.stackexchange.com/q/4071/330"
          >a StackExchange question about that</a

        <br /><b id="Branching">Branching</b><br />
        Branching is supported only via <span class="inline_code">If</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">If</span>-<span class="inline_code">Else</span
        >, and <span class="inline_code">If</span>-<span class="inline_code"
          >ElseIf</span
        >-<span class="inline_code">Else</span>. There is no equivalent of C,
        C++ and JavaScript <span class="inline_code">switch</span>-<span
          class="inline_code"
          >case</span
        >. After the <span class="inline_code">If</span> token, the compiler
        expects a condition. In AEC for WebAssembly, the condition ends with a
        <span class="inline_code">Then</span>, while, in AEC for x86, the
        condition ends with a newline character. The branching ends with
        <span class="inline_code">EndIf</span>. That's to make the program
        easier to parse, and to prevent
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else">dangling-else</a>.
        Between <span class="inline_code">Then</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">EndIf</span>, there can be an
        <span class="inline_code">Else</span> token. Before the
        <span class="inline_code">Else</span> token (if there is one, otherwise
        it's before the <span class="inline_code">EndIf</span>) there can be an
        <span class="inline_code">ElseIf</span> token. An
        <span class="inline_code">ElseIf</span> token, much like the
        <span class="inline_code">If</span> token, is followed by an expression
        representing a condition, which is ended by the
        <span class="inline_code">Then</span> token. After the
        <span class="inline_code">Then</span> token and after the
        <span class="inline_code">Else</span> token, you can put an
        <span class="inline_code">{</span> (curly brace) which the compiler will
        ignore. Similarly, you can put an
        <span class="inline_code">}</span> before
        <span class="inline_code">EndIf</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">ElseIf</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">Else</span>. That is to make it easier to use
        text editors made primarily for C like languages for writing AEC (to
        jump to the end of the code block, for example). An example from the
        Analog Clock in AEC:
        <pre>
        If signature[j] = '\n' Then
            i := (i / windowWidth + 1) * windowWidth;
        ElseIf not(signature[j] = 0) Then
            output[i] := signature[j];
            colors[i] :=   modraColor;
            i         :=        i + 1;
        Else
            output[i] := ' ';
        EndIf</pre
        >
        If there is an <span class="inline_code">ElseIf</span> token inside the
        <span class="inline_code">If</span>-statement, there, of course, doesn't
        need to be an <span class="inline_code">Else</span> token:
        <pre>
            If j &lt; 2 and (output[i - windowWidth] = 'x' and
                (output[i + 1] = 'x' or output[i - 1] = 'x')) Then
                output[i] :=            'x';
                colors[i] := darkGreenColor;
            ElseIf j=2 and (output[i + 1]=' ' and
                output[i - windowWidth] = 'x') Then
                output[i] := ' ';
            EndIf</pre
        >
        Note that, unlike in Ada or VHDL, there is no semicolon after the
        <span class="inline_code">EndIf</span> token. That is, you can put the
        semicolon <span class="inline_code">;</span> after
        <span class="inline_code">EndIf</span> if you want to, but you do not
        have to. I often put it so that ClangFormat does not get confused. When
        programming in VHDL, Ada or Pascal, it bothered me why I needed to put a
        semi-colon after <span class="inline_code">end if</span> (ADA and VHDL)
        or <span class="inline_code">end</span> (Pascal). I mean,
        <span class="inline_code">EndIf</span> by itself means an end of a
        statement, so why put another sign for ending a statement there? Is not
        it some kind of a pleonasm? I have asked a

        Simple branching can also be done using the
        <span class="inline_code">?:</span> operator. As it is
        right-associative, it can be used to concisely write
        <span class="inline_code">ElseIf</span> statements. An example of that
        from Arithmetic Operators Test (one of the first programs I wrote in AEC
        for WebAssembly):

Function signum(Integer32 number) Which Returns Integer32 Does
    /*

     * And, as of time of writing this, I haven't yet implemented
     * the "If" statement into the AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler.
     */
    Return (number&lt;0)? //If the number is less than 0...
                    -1 //signum of that number is -1...

        that AEC-to-x86 compiler actually produces incorrect code for the
        <span class="inline_code">?:</span> operator. Namely, the code it
        produces calculates the results of the second operand and the third
        operand before calculating the result of the first operand (the
        condition), which can, according to that <i>rici</i>, lead to unexpected
        divide-by-zero errors for expressions such as
        <span class="inline_code">d = 0 ? 0 : n / d</span> (if
        <span class="inline_code">d</span> is equal to zero). There does not
        seem to be a simple solution, given the way my AEC-to-x86 compiler is
        structured. Here is the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/ArithmeticExpressionCompiler/blob/3530fabc2fc403c70cee5d34ad13aafdeeb87f6a/compiler.html#L860"

        made the core of it when I was 20, while I made the core of the

        problem. It is also easier to implement the ternary operator when
        targetting WebAssembly than when targetting x86 because WebAssembly
        itself essentially has the ternary operator just with a different
        (LISP-like) syntax. Here is

        So, as far as I can see, you can run into at least two problems when
        implementing the <span class="inline_code">?:</span> operator in your

        Even in C++, it is generally agreed upon that using the conditional
        operator on the left-hand side of the assignment is very bad style which
        makes programs unnecessarily more difficult to read, and JavaScript does
        not allow it at all. Nevertheless, I think allowing it is not
        fundamentally different from allowing the conditional operator on the
        right-hand-side and other expressions.<br />

        In C++, the following program compiles:
        <pre
          class="cxx_program"
        ><span class="PreProc">#include </span><span class="Constant">&lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span class="Statement">using</span> <span class="Type">namespace</span> std;

        <span class="Statement">while</span> (b&gt;<span class="Constant">0</span>)
                ((a&gt;b)?a:b)=((a&gt;b)?(a-b):(b-a));
        cout &lt;&lt;a &lt;&lt;endl;
}</pre>
        However, this program refuses to compile with some confusing error
        message:
        <pre
          class="cxx_program"
        ><span class="PreProc">#include </span><span class="Constant">&lt;iostream&gt;</span>

<span class="Statement">using</span> <span class="Type">namespace</span> std;

<span class="Type">int</span> main() {
        <span class="Type">int</span> a=<span class="Constant">15</span>;
        <span class="Type">float</span> b=<span class="Constant">25</span>;
        <span class="Statement">while</span> (b&gt;<span class="Constant">0</span>)

        cout &lt;&lt;a &lt;&lt;endl;
}</pre>
        The only difference between those two programs is whether we declare the
        variable <span class="inline_code">b</span> as
        <span class="inline_code">float</span> (equivalent to AEC
        <span class="inline_code">Decimal32</span>) or as
        <span class="inline_code">int</span> (on most compilers, that is
        equivalent to AEC <span class="inline_code">Integer32</span>). Compilers
        will refuse to compile the second program with some error message from
        which it is not obvious that the issue will be solved by changing
        <span class="inline_code">float</span> to
        <span class="inline_code">int</span>. In my opinion, that is hardly
        acceptable, and the AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler accepts the equivalents
        of both programs.<br />

        For now, there is only one type of loop in AEC, the
        <span class="inline_code">While</span>-loop. A
        <span class="inline_code">While</span> token is followed by an
        expression representing a condition. That expression ends with a newline
        character in AEC for x86, and with a
        <span class="inline_code">Loop</span> token in AEC for WebAssembly. In
        both of them, the <span class="inline_code">While</span>-statement ends
        with an <span class="inline_code">EndWhile</span> token. For example,
        here is what the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">
          Euclid Algorithm</a
        >
        looks like in AEC for WebAssembly (an excerpt from
        <a href="euclidTest.html">Euclid Test</a>):
        <pre>
    While not(b=0) Loop
        If a&gt;b Then
            a:=mod(a,b);
        Else
            If a=0 Then
                Return b;
            EndIf
            b:=mod(b,a);
        EndIf

        It uses the built-in function
        <span class="inline_code">mod(Integer64 a, Integer64 b)</span> to get
        the remainder of the division. AEC for x86 supports it both for integers
        and decimal numbers, whereas AEC for WebAssembly supports it only for
        integers (for the simple reason that WebAssembly doesn't support it for
        decimal numbers either). Nevertheless, there is a simple way to write it
        yourself in AEC for WebAssembly (excerpt from the Analog Clock):
        <pre>
Function fmod(Decimal32 a, Decimal32 b) Which Returns Decimal32 Does
    Return a - b * Integer32(a / b);
EndFunction</pre
        >
        It might actually be a good idea to use
        <span class="inline_code">Integer64(</span> instead of
        <span class="inline_code">Integer32(</span>, because there is no
        guarantee that <span class="inline_code">a / b</span> will be in the
        range of <span class="inline_code">Integer32</span>. So, that's how you
        do casting in AEC, with the built-in functions named
        <span class="inline_code">DataType(</span>.<br />
        <b>TODO:</b> Think of some nice syntax for the
        <span class="inline_code">for</span>-loop, every remotely modern
        language has a <span class="inline_code">for</span>-loop. Also,
        implement something like C, C++ and JavaScript
        <span class="inline_code">break</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">continue</span>. Most of the time, they are a
        sign of bad code design, but sometimes they aren't, and it's not
        acceptable for a language to discourage them.<br />
        <br /><b id="Functions">Functions</b><br />
        AEC for x86 supports no user-added functions. Furthermore, the parser
        implemented there doesn't support functions with more than 2 arguments.
        AEC for WebAssembly supports functions, because WebAssembly makes it
        easy to implement them (x86 assembly doesn't have a standardized way to
        call functions, the way it's done varies by operating system). Importing
        functions from JavaScript is done like this (excerpt from Analog Clock):
        <pre>
//Let's import some functions useful for debugging from JavaScript...
Function logString(CharacterPointer str) Which Returns Nothing Is External;
Function logInteger(Integer32 int) Which Returns Nothing Is External;</pre
        >
        So, function declaration starts with a
        <span class="inline_code">Function</span> token. After it, comes a
        function name (ending with an open parenthesis
        <span class="inline_code">(</span>). After that, comes the list of
        arguments (it may be empty, and it often is). An element of that list
        consists of an argument type and an argument name. Unlike in C, argument
        name is obligatory and the parser is going to complain if you don't
        insert it. And there doesn't appear to be a simple way to change that.
        Arguments are separated by a colon token
        <span class="inline_code">,</span>. After that comes a
        <span class="inline_code">Which</span> token, after which comes a
        <span class="inline_code">Returns</span> token. Then comes a return type
        (which can be a data type or <span class="inline_code">Nothing</span>).
        If the function is being imported from JavaScript, then comes the
        <span class="inline_code">Is</span>-token,
        <span class="inline_code">External</span>-token and a semicolon. If the
        function is implemented in AEC, there comes the
        <span class="inline_code">Does</span>-token, then comes the function
        body which ends with the <span class="inline_code">EndFunction</span>
        token. A function exits when the control flow reaches the
        <span class="inline_code">EndFunction</span>-token or when it reaches a
        <span class="inline_code">Return</span>-statement. If the function
        returns <span class="inline_code">Nothing</span>, a
        <span class="inline_code">Return</span>-statement consists only of a
        <span class="inline_code">Return</span>-token and a semicolon. If a
        function returns something, there needs to be an expression between a
        <span class="inline_code">Return</span>-token and a semicolon, the
        result of which the function will return to its caller. If the control
        flow of a function that returns something reaches the
        <span class="inline_code">EndFunction</span>-token, the function returns
        0 (in sharp contrast with both C-like languages, where such a function
        returns an undefined value, and Rust, where such a function returns a
        value of last expression in it). There have been a few examples of
        functions in this specification. Arguments to functions may have default
        values, specified as follows (excerpt from Empty Function Test):
        <pre>
Function empty_function(Character charArgument:='A',
                        Integer16 shortArgument:=4096,
                        Integer32 intArgument:=32768,
                        Integer64 longArgument:=8*exp(9*log(10)),
                        Decimal32 floatArgument:=22/7,
                        Decimal64 doubleArgument:=pi)
         Which Returns Nothing Does
    //It does nothing, but the compiler should still generate valid code.
EndFunction</pre
        >
        Now, if you call such a function with fewer than 6 arguments, the
        compiler will not complain, but will supply the rest with default
        values. Note that this will not work when calling an AEC function from
        JavaScript. SmallBasic, the first programming language I learned, back
        when I was 9 years old, from the now-shut-down

        harder to implement recursive functions, and that was one of the
        problems I faced it when making my Labyrinth game (also mentioned in the
        introduction) in it. I solved it by storing what should be local
        variables on global stacks (which SmallBasic standard library includes).

        <span class="inline_code">asm(</span> assumes that nothing will be left
        on the system stack by the inline assembly code, while other ones assume
        that a certain WebAssembly type (corresponding to some AEC type) will be
        left on the system stack by it, which they will then fetch. Since
        WebAssembly type <span class="inline_code">i32</span> corresponds to AEC

        <a href="#multiline_strings">multiline strings</a>, in fact, that's what
        I recommend for inline assembly. When writing inline assembly in C or

        ><br />
        <b>UPDATE</b> on 15/02/2023: I have implemented that you can access
        variables from inline assembly by their names, by inserting the
        <span class="inline_code">%</span> character and then the name of a
        variable. So, no need to add additional arguments to
        <span class="inline_code">asm</span> in order to use variables from
        inline assembly, like you do in CLANG or GCC. I realize there are
        benefits to what CLANG and GCC are doing, but it's both more difficult
        to implement in the compiler and more difficult to use. So, the code
        above has been changed to this:
        <pre>
Function sqrt(Decimal32 x) Which Returns Decimal32 Does {
  If USE_WEBASSEMBLY_SQRT_INSTRUCTION Then {
    Return asm_f32(
        R"multiline((f32.sqrt

	)
))multiline");
  }
  EndIf;</pre
        >
        In order to enable modifying the variables from inline assembly, the
        compiler will not insert assembly code loading that variable, but
        assembly code representing a pointer to that variable. In this case, it
        makes the inline assembly slightly more complicated, but, in many other
        cases, it will make it a lot simpler. In case you need to insert the
        actual <span class="inline_code">%</span> character inside inline
        assembly (which I think you never have to in the WebAssembly Text
        Format), simply write <span class="inline_code">%%</span>. Due to the
        way the AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler is structured internally (and I
        still wouldn't know how to do it better), this feature of refering to
        variables from inline assembly is not available if the inline assembly
        is in the global scope (outside of a function), and the compiler issues

        AEC for x86 has many built-in functions, wrappers around x86 assembly
        instructions. These are: <span class="inline_code">sin(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">cos(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">tan(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">atan2(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">arctan(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">ctg(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">arcctg(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">sqrt(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">arcsin(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">arccos(</span>,
        <span class="inline_code">ln(</span> (natural logarithm),
        <span class="inline_code">log(</span> (base-10 logarithm),
        <span class="inline_code">exp(</span> (returns the Euler number to the
        power of the argument), <span class="inline_code">pow(</span> (which,
        unfortunately, due to the limitations of mathematical functions built
        into x86 assembly, causes an error whenever the first argument is
        negative or zero, and there does not appear to be a simple solution),
        <span class="inline_code">abs(</span> and
        <span class="inline_code">mod(</span> (floating-point modulo). Unlike in
        most programming languages, trigonometric functions expect arguments in
        degrees (not radians, as in C, C++ or JavaScript). Similarly, the
        cyclometric functions such as <span class="inline_code">atan2(</span>
        return the result in degrees, rather than in radians. If you want to use

        functions, because they are methods of the

        , where <i>s</i> is the sortedness of the array (-1 when the array is
        inverse-sorted, 1 when it is sorted, around 0 when it is randomly
        shuffled), and <i>ln</i> being the natural logarithm, base
        <i>e = 2.718...</i>. I am not sure how to test how correct that
        approximation is. My algorithm is recursive, and for every iteration of
        the recursion, it estimates whether it should behave like QuickSort or
        like MergeSort based on those formulas. In case the array is very small,
        so that SelectionSort is faster than both QuickSort and MergeSort, or in
        case it runs of stack memory, it runs SelectionSort. However, for some
        reason, my algorithm is significantly slower than JavaScript

        I am not sure what causes those <i>stairs</i> in the measurement
        results. Professor Alfonzo Baumgartner thinks it has to do with cache
        misses, here is what he wrote when I asked him about that in an e-mail:
        <div class="quotation" lang="hr">
          Po&#353;tovani,<br />
          obja&#353;njenje koje ja nudim za te 'stepenice' je u &#269;injenici
          da svi procesori koriste cache memoriju u koje spremaju odre&#273;eni
          broj memorijskih stranica.<br />
          Ako uzmemo da je jedna memorijska stranica npr. 64K, onda, &#269;im se
          na&#353; niz pove&#263;a samo za 1 element vi&#353;e od 64K, potrebne
          su dvije memorijske stranice. &#268;im se na&#353; niz prostire na
          dvije memorijske stranice, odmah je mogu&#263;nost tzv. 'cache
          miss'-ova kada procesor ne&#263;e prona&#263;i u svome L1 cache-u tu
          stranicu pa mora do&#263;i do zamjene stranica unutar cache, &#353;to
          usporava izvo&#273;enje programa.<br />

          Kako Vi pove&#263;avate niz, tako se koristi sve vi&#353;e memorijskih
          stranica u kojima je on zapisan, a sam cache-ing sistem onda ima
          vi&#353;e posla oko njihovih zamjena.
          <br />
          Zato se za neke duljine nizova dobiva skoro isti rezultat, a onda
          &#269;im pove&#263;amo samo za jedan podatak (koji ide u novu mem.
          stranicu) dobijemo 'drasti&#269;no' uve&#263;an rezultat mjerenja.
          <br />
          Ne znam jeste li me shvatili i nisam siguran 100% da je to kod Vas
          uzrok tih 'stepenica', ali na prvi pogled mi se &#269;ini takvo
          ne&#353;to..
          <br />
          Alfonzo.
        </div>
        In any case, I think this is an interesting result worth of further
        exploration. Which sorting algorithms have those <i>stairs</i> when
        measured? Why do some do, and some (like JavaScript
        <span class="inline_code">Array.sort</span>) do not, on the same array?
        <br />
        <br />
        <b id="DifferencesInDialects">Example program in both dialects of AEC</b
        ><br />
        So, here is an example piece of code in the x86 dialect of AEC:
        <pre>
i := 0
While i < n | i = n
	If i = 0
		fib(i) := 0
	ElseIf i = 1
		fib(i) := 1
	Else
		fib(i) := fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2)
	EndIf
	i := i + 1
EndWhile
fib(n)</pre
        >
        And here is its near-equivalent in the WebAssembly dialect of AEC:
        <pre>
Function fib(Integer16 n) Which Returns Decimal64 Does
  Integer16 i := 0;
  Decimal64 fib[100];
  While i < n or i = n Loop
     If i = 0 Then
       fib[i] := 0;
     ElseIf i = 1 Then
       fib[i] := 1;
     Else
       fib[i] := fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
     EndIf
     i += 1;
  EndWhile
  Return fib[n];
EndFunction</pre

        I think AEC is a promising project, but a lot of work is still needed to
        make it successful. I don't think I can do everything that's needed for
        it to be successful by myself. (<i
          >UPDATE on 06/06/2021: It would, for example, be useful to make a
          web-based IDE for the AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler, so that somebody
          can try my programming language directly in the browser. I have opened

          AEC-to-WebAssembly compiler, which can already run in NodeJS if
          compiled with EMSCRIPTEN, to run in a browser, and, to be honest, I do
          not know enough WebAssembly to do that by myself. Actually, I think
          almost no web-developer these days has the knowledge needed to make
          that. We would also need to embed the
          <span class="inline_code">wat2wasm</span> from WebAssembly Binary
          Toolkit to run in that web-app, as my compiler relies on it to convert
          the WebAssembly assembly language it outputs to the bytecode that
          browsers understand. Somebody has already made

        about the way I structured my compiler.<br />
        I once learned that a Serbian company called RT-RK, that also has an
        office in Osijek, where I was living at the time, was searching for a
        compiler developer. So I sent them via e-mail the AEC-to-WebAssembly
        compiler on GitHub, to finally get an entry-level job, after I had been
        learning to program for 8 years. They did not even invite me for an
        interview. They responded me in an e-mail that they are searching for
        somebody who knows in details how GCC or LLVM, preferably both, work
        internally, and that my project does not show them that I know that.<br />

        <b>UPDATE</b> on 05/01/2023: A question I often get asked on Internet
        forums is, if I have made my programming language, why haven't I also
        made my own operating system? The answer is fairly simple: While I do
        have some ideas about what a good programming language would look like
        and work internally (as you can probably tell by reading the
        documentation of my programming language), I have no idea what a good
        operating system would work like. So, I haven't made my own operating
        system, and I probably never will.<br />

        So, in other words, I think you should make a global array of TreeNode
        structures, and make another array to track which elements of that array
        are actually being used and which ones aren't. And write functions which
        allow you to allocate a TreeNode and deallocate a TreeNode.
