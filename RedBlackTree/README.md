# Red-Black Trees in AEC

So, this is my attempt to implement the Red-Black Trees algorithm in the AEC programming language. You can (hopefully) see it live [on GitHub Pages](https://flatassembler.github.io/RedBlackTree) and on [SourceForge Project Web](https://aecforwebassembly.sourceforge.io/RedBlackTree.html).
