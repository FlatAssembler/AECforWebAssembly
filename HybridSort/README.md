# HybridSort in AEC

This is my attempt to port my [HybridSort implementation](https://github.com/FlatAssembler/ArithmeticExpressionCompiler/blob/master/recursive_HybridSort/hybrid_sort.aec) from x86 to WebAssembly. The comments will still be in Croatian, because this is primarily intended for my fellow Croatian students and for my professors. `rezultati_mjerenja.jpg` depicts measurements of the performance of JavaScript `Array.sort` and AEC `HybridSort` for large arrays. For now, JavaScript `Array.sort` is significantly faster.
