#AEC for WebAssembly

This is my attempt to port the [ArithmeticExpressionCompiler](https://github.com/FlatAssembler/ArithmeticExpressionCompiler) language to WebAssembly (the JavaScript bytecode). Right now, it's in the very early stages of development. I am also trying to learn C++, which is allegedly a significantly better language than JavaScript is (the first version of ArithmeticExpressionCompiler is written in JavaScript) when it comes to writing compilers. So, the only thing I've managed to do right now is to rewrite the tokenizer and the parser to C++.
