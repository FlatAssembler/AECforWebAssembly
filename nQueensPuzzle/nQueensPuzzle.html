    <h1>N-Queens Puzzle</h1>
    I have decided to write a solution to the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">
      N-Queens Puzzle</a
    >, one of the classic problems in computer science, in the
    <a href="https://flatassembler.github.io/AEC_specification.html"
      >AEC programming language</a
    >. That puzzle asks in how many ways you can arrange <i>n</i> chess queens
    on an <i>n</i>-times-<i>n</i> chessboard without breaking the rules that no
    two chess queens can be in the same row, column or diagonal.
    <br />
    <b>This only works in very modern browsers.</b> <del>I'm not too interested in
    targeting archaic browsers here. This only works in Firefox 62 and newer or
    Chrome 69 and newer (those with support <code>WebAssembly.Global</code>).
    After a few years (if not months), all JavaScript environments will become
    as capable as they are, rather than like Internet Explorer.</del><br/>
    I've fiddled with WebAssembly a bit, and this should now work in Firefox 52 
    (the last version of Firefox running on Windows XP) as long as one has
    WebAssembly enabled (by going to <code>about:config</code> and setting
    <code>javascript.wasm</code> to <code>true</code>).

    AEC program output:<br />

    <br />
    You can see the source code of the AEC program
    <a href="nQueensPuzzle.aec.html">here</a>. It may be a little hard to
    understand. If that's the case, try first understanding the
    <a href="permutationsTest.html">Permutations Test</a>, as it uses the same
    algorithm to solve a simpler problem.<br /><br />
    UPDATE on 19/02/2024: I've ported this program to the x86 dialect of AEC.
    The source code is available in this <a href="Duktape.zip">ZIP archive</a>,
    in the file <code>nQueensPuzzle.aec</code>. Or, in case you want to risk
    getting a virus from my computer, you can download this
    <a
      href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/ArithmeticExpressionCompiler/raw/master/ArithmeticExpressionCompiler.zip"
      >ZIP archive</a
    >
    which contains both the source code and the Windows executable. The x86
    dialect of AEC doesn't support functions and it doesn't support structures.
    I hope you can appreciate how they make the code easier to understand. The
    WebAssembly version of this program uses recursion, whereas the x86 version
    of this program uses the stack instead of recursion.<br /><br />
    UPDATE on 24/02/2024: I have started

      >a Reddit thread about N Queens Puzzle in various programming languages</a
    >. I had no idea such short solutions to the N Queens Puzzle were
    possible.<br /><br />
    UPDATE on 21/03/2024: I've started learning the Dart programming language
    and have <a href="nQueensPuzzle.dart">ported this program to Dart</a>. It
    uses an algorithm similar to the one used in the x86 AEC N Queens Puzzle
    solution, except that the stack is a two-dimensional list.<br /><br />
    UPDATE on 26/04/2025: I've made a similar program (<del
      >but without the ability to print ASCII chessboards</del
    >)
    <a href="https://picoblaze-simulator.sourceforge.io/PicoBlaze.html?id=101"

      chessboards as well, just without the decoration. It outputs them in the
