# The N-Queens Puzzle

I have decided to write a solution to the [N-Queens Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle), one of the classic problems in computer science, in the AEC programming language. That puzzle asks in how many ways you can arrange n chess queens on an n-times-n chessboard without breaking the rules that no two chess queens can be in the same row, column or diagonal.  You can (hopefully) see this program live [on my website](https://flatassembler.github.io/nQueensPuzzle.html).
