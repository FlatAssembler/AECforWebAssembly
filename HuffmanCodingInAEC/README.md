# Huffman Coding in AEC

This will be my attempt to implement the Huffman's algorithm for data compression in AEC. A few years ago, I implemented it in JavaScript, which you can see [here](https://flatassembler.github.io/huffman.html). You can see this program alive [on GitHub Pages](https://flatassembler.github.io/HuffmanCodingInAEC.html) and on [SourceForge Project Web](https://aecforwebassembly.sourceforge.io/HuffmanCodingInAEC.html).
