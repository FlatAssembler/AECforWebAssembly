# Roman Numerals
A program that converts Arabic numerals to Roman numerals. You can see it live [on my website](https://flatassembler.github.io/roman_numerals).

**WARNING: This can only be compiled using AECforWebAssembly `v2.4.0` and newer, because it uses global two-dimensional character arrays.**
